# Website Project — AI Training & Consumer Psychology

## About the Owner
- AI trainer and coach, also specialized in consumer psychology
- Based in Austria, targeting the DACH (German-speaking) market first, then international
- Website will be bilingual: German (primary) and English
- Does not have the scale/fame of the reference sites yet — building from the ground up

## Project Overview
Building a personal brand website that combines the best elements from five analyzed competitor/inspiration sites:
- **Dirk Kreuter** (dirkkreuter.com) — dark premium design, video hero + lead capture popup, case studies with metrics, product ladder
- **Tony Robbins** (tonyrobbins.com) — About trilogy (Story/System/Science), scientific credibility, color-coded offerings, phone + consultation conversion
- **Jordan Belfort** (jb.online) — direct pricing for entry products, corporate training tiers, AI mastermind format, "Book Me" page
- **Tim Ferriss** (tim.blog) — content-first blog, "Start Here" page, podcast as trust engine, simple newsletter (5-Bullet Friday)
- **Mark Manson** (markmanson.net) — anti-BS voice, newsletter-first funnel, affordable membership, AI-powered product (Purpose app), dark mode, topic-organized content

## Brand Positioning
- "KI-Stratege & Konsumentenpsychologe" / "AI Strategist & Consumer Psychologist"
- Anti-hype, science-backed, practical, direct
- Differentiator: combines AI expertise with consumer psychology — understands both the technology AND the human side of adoption
