# Website Project — AI Training & Consumer Psychology

## About the Owner
- AI trainer and coach, also specialized in consumer psychology
- Based in Austria, targeting the DACH (German-speaking) market first, then international
- Website will be bilingual: German (primary) and English
- Does not have the scale/fame of the reference sites yet — building from the ground up

## Project Overview
Building a personal brand website that combines the best elements from five analyzed competitor/inspiration sites:
- **Dirk Kreuter** (dirkkreuter.com) — dark premium design, video hero + lead capture popup, case studies with metrics, product ladder
- **Tony Robbins** (tonyrobbins.com) — About trilogy (Story/System/Science), scientific credibility, color-coded offerings, phone + consultation conversion
- **Jordan Belfort** (jb.online) — direct pricing for entry products, corporate training tiers, AI mastermind format, "Book Me" page
- **Tim Ferriss** (tim.blog) — content-first blog, "Start Here" page, podcast as trust engine, simple newsletter (5-Bullet Friday)
- **Mark Manson** (markmanson.net) — anti-BS voice, newsletter-first funnel, affordable membership, AI-powered product (Purpose app), dark mode, topic-organized content

## Brand Positioning
- "KI-Trainer & Konsumentenpsychologe" / "AI Trainer & Consumer Psychologist"
- Anti-hype, science-backed, practical, direct
- Differentiator: combines AI expertise with consumer psychology — understands both the technology AND the human side of adoption
- Target audience: Führungskräfte who know AI will change their business but don't know where to start

- Features: CSS snap scroll, custom wheel/touch/keyboard handlers, IntersectionObserver, gold nav dots, prefers-reduced-motion fallback

### What's Done
- **Trust bar**: 7 real logos (SVG, grayscale filter) — became ai (with text), REAL TEAM, ZR Team Vienna (with text), ARS Akademie, Innovatic Group, Sport Union, YouKnowMeBest, FitRock. Marquee animation, duplicated tracks.
- **SURF Method badge**: Color SVG overlay on About photo (`bottom: 70px; right: 64px; 120x120px`)
- **Hero copy**: Badge says "KI-Trainer & Konsumentenpsychologe". Subtitle: "Sie wissen, dass KI Ihr Business verändern wird. Sie wissen nur nicht, wo Sie anfangen sollen. Dafür bin ich da."
- **Services copy**: "Kein Frontalunterricht. Kein Standardprogramm." — emphasizes personalization and tangible outputs per session
- **Real testimonials (German)**: Katarzyna Pichler (Innovatic Group) and Patrik Hubek (FitRock) with headshot photos
- **Austrian syntax**: All em dashes replaced with " - "
- LAMASSU KI LAB logo removed from trust bar

### What's Still Needed
- **Booking link**: All "Erstgespräch buchen" buttons link to `#` — needs Calendly or similar
- **Legal pages**: Impressum, Datenschutz, AGB all link to `#` — required by Austrian law
- **Use case metrics**: Proof slide numbers are still placeholder (3x, 47%, 89%)
- **Domain + hosting**: No decision yet (GitHub Pages, Vercel, Netlify)
- **English version**: Future task
- **More testimonials**: Only 2 real ones
- **Overall text review**: User wants to review all copy together
- **Push to remote**: 2 commits made locally, not yet pushed

## Future Expansion
- **"Über mich" subpage**: Full bio with personal stories (scuba diving, saving best friend's life, sports background), detailed credentials, hobbies, philosophy. The "Mehr über mich" button on the landing page should link here once built.
- **Use Cases subpage**: Dedicated page with detailed case studies for B2B managers
- **Newsletter**: Once established
- **English version**: Bilingual site
- **Blog**: Real content replacing placeholder cards
- **Booking integration**: Calendly or similar for "Erstgespräch buchen"
