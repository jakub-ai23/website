## 1. HOMEPAGE STRUCTURE

### Hero Section
- Full-screen **background image** of Tony Robbins on stage with dramatic blue/futuristic lighting effects
- Dark blue gradient overlay for text readability
- Headline: "Tony Robbins' Premier Event"
- Subheading describing a 4-day transformative experience
- Primary CTA: **"Save My Seat"** (links to external ticketing)
- **"Next Event" card** showing upcoming event details (date, location, format)
- No pop-up lead capture on homepage (unlike Dirk Kreuter — conversion happens via event cards and phone CTAs instead)

### Key Difference from Dirk Kreuter:
- Kreuter uses a **lead capture pop-up** immediately; Robbins uses a **direct event promotion** hero. Robbins' approach assumes brand recognition — visitors already know who he is. For a newer brand, a lead capture approach (like Kreuter's) may convert better.

## 2. DESIGN SYSTEM

| Element | Tony Robbins | Your Adaptation |
|---|---|---|
| **Color scheme** | Deep blue (#022886, #0e3783) + event-specific accent colors | Dark base + bold accent — blue conveys trust & authority |
| **Event color coding** | Each event has its own color: cyan (#2764ff), teal (#3ceba0), purple (#8840ff), yellow (#fbf073), green (#6ecf55) | Color-code your different services/programs for visual differentiation |
| **Typography** | "Suisse Intl" (primary), "IBM Plex Mono" (technical), "IBM Plex Sans" (fallback) — premium Swiss typography | Modern sans-serif with clear hierarchy |
| **Style** | Minimalist, generous white space, gradient overlays, high-quality photography, full-bleed imagery | Premium, clean aesthetic — less glassmorphism than Kreuter, more editorial |
| **Imagery** | Dramatic stage shots, event photography with cinematic lighting, emotional crowd shots | Professional photos of you in action — training, speaking, coaching |

### Color Palette Details:
- Primary: Deep blue (#022886, #0e3783)
- White/light text on dark backgrounds
- Per-event accents: cyan, teal, purple, yellow, green

## 13. KEY TAKEAWAYS FOR YOUR SITE

1. **The "About Trilogy" is brilliant** — Split your story into Story (emotional), System/Framework (logical), and Science/Research (credibility). As someone in consumer psychology, you have a natural advantage here.

2. **Color-code your offerings** — Give each service its own visual identity (workshop = blue, coaching = green, corporate training = purple). It helps visitors instantly distinguish products.

3. **Scientific credibility is your superpower** — Tony uses Stanford studies. You can cite behavioral psychology research, AI productivity studies, and neuroscience findings. This differentiates you from "just another AI trainer."

4. **Phone-first vs. form-first** — Robbins goes heavy on phone calls with "Personal Results Specialists." For a smaller operation, Calendly scheduling + email capture may be more practical, but having a phone option adds legitimacy.

5. **Free entry point matters** — The "Breakthrough Strategy Session" (free call) is a powerful funnel entry. Consider offering a free "AI Readiness Assessment" or "Consumer Psychology Audit" call.

6. **Daily schedule breakdowns reduce fear** — Showing "Day 1: X, Day 2: Y" makes expensive events feel tangible and worth the investment.

7. **Cross-sell on every page** — Every event page shows related events in a carousel at the bottom. Never let a visitor reach a dead end.

8. **Application model for premium offerings** — Making people apply (instead of just buy) creates exclusivity and filters for qualified leads.

9. **Contribution/giving page builds trust** — Even modest charitable work humanizes your brand.

10. **Thematic content organization** catches search traffic — Organizing blog/resources by theme (not date) makes content discoverable and evergreen.
