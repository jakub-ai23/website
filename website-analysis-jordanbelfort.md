## 1. HOMEPAGE STRUCTURE

### Hero Section
- Banner image with **"Jordan Belfort - The Real Wolf of Wall Street"**
- Sub-positioning: "Investment Guru | World's #1 Sales Trainer | Entrepreneurship Expert"
- Primary CTA: **"Shop our products"** → links to `/collections/courses`
- **No video background, no pop-up, no lead capture form** in the hero (simpler approach than Kreuter and Robbins)
- Clean, professional, white-background aesthetic

### Key Difference from Kreuter & Robbins:
- Belfort's homepage is **simpler and more e-commerce focused** (Shopify-based). It's designed to sell courses directly rather than drive consultation calls or event registrations. The famous personal brand does the heavy lifting.

## 2. DESIGN SYSTEM

| Element | Jordan Belfort | Your Adaptation |
|---|---|---|
| **Color scheme** | White backgrounds + yellow/gold (#fec52e) accents + dark charcoal (#333333) text | Clean, light aesthetic with bold accent — more accessible than Kreuter/Robbins' dark themes |
| **Typography** | "DIN" (headers) + "Montserrat" (body, weights 400/600/700) | Modern sans-serif pairing, very readable |
| **Style** | Minimalist luxury, generous whitespace, clean grid layouts, high-quality photography | Professional without being corporate — less dramatic than Robbins |
| **Imagery** | Professional photos, corporate client logos, lifestyle shots | Clean and polished |
| **Platform** | Shopify (e-commerce first) | Different approach — products are directly purchasable, not consultation-gated |

### Color Palette Details:
- Primary accent: Yellow/Gold (#fec52e) — buttons, highlights
- Text: Dark charcoal (#333333)
- Backgrounds: White (#ffffff)
- Footer: Dark gray (#333333) with white text
- Overall: Brighter, more accessible feel than Kreuter's dark theme or Robbins' deep blue

## 3. NAVIGATION STRUCTURE

```
Main Menu:
├── Shop
│   ├── Courses (/collections/courses)
│   └── Merchandise (/collections/merchandise)
├── Corporate Training (/pages/interactive-sales-training-program)
├── Media (/pages/media)
├── Mastermind (/pages/ai-mastermind)
├── Book Jordan (/pages/book-jb)
└── Log In (/account/login)
```

**Key Insight:** Much simpler navigation than Robbins (who has 30+ menu items) or Kreuter. Only 5 main items. This works because Belfort has fewer products and relies on his brand name recognition.

**Language Switcher:** Supports English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Russian via GTranslate — smart for international reach.

- Topics discussed in press: GameStop, cryptocurrency predictions, market dynamics

### Approach:
Simple page — podcast + video series + press logos. Less elaborate than Kreuter's press page but effective because the brand is so well-known.

**Your adaptation:** Even a simple media page with your podcast/video content and any press mentions adds significant credibility.

- **No testimonials or case studies on product pages** — massive gap for a $3,999 product

- **No countdown timers or real urgency** — permanent "50% off" feels less urgent
- **No before/after transformation section** — missed opportunity
- **No "About" or "Story" page** — relies entirely on external brand recognition

## 14. KEY TAKEAWAYS FOR YOUR SITE

1. **Direct pricing can work** — Belfort shows prices openly, which reduces friction for mid-ticket ($249-$499) products. Consider showing pricing for your entry/mid products while keeping high-ticket consultation-only.

2. **The free eBook lead magnet is effective and simple** — easier to implement than Kreuter's event system or Robbins' free strategy call. Create a high-value PDF guide.

3. **Three-pillar expertise positioning is powerful** — "Investment Guru | Sales Master | Entrepreneurship Expert." Your version: "AI Trainer | Consumer Psychologist | Business Coach."

4. **Corporate training tiers are a great B2B model** — Essentials → Business → Premium → Enterprise with escalating features. Perfect for your AI training business.

5. **The AI Mastermind format is directly relevant** — Belfort combines his core expertise (sales) with AI. You can do the same: combine consumer psychology with AI implementation.

6. **"Book Me" page with tabbed services works well** — Speaking, Consulting, Media, Training in one organized page.

7. **Learn from his weaknesses:**
   - ADD testimonials and case studies (Belfort is missing them)
   - ADD a before/after transformation section (Belfort doesn't have one)
   - ADD an "About/Story" page (Belfort relies on fame alone)
   - ADD scientific credibility (you have consumer psychology research to cite)
   - USE video in your hero (Belfort's static hero is the weakest of the three sites)

8. **Multi-language support is smart** if you have international clients — GTranslate is easy to implement.

9. **Money-back guarantee reduces risk** — Belfort offers 30 days. Consider this for your digital courses.

10. **"Minting millionaires since 1988"** is a brilliant tagline — create your own memorable credibility statement.
